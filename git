checking out files, commits and branches.

git checkout master
git branch -r
git branch
git checkout -b branch_name

git log
git log --oneline
This will display the id of your commits of the branch in which you are.

git checkout id_of_commit
git checkout id_of_commit file_name
git checkout HEAD file_name

***Git hides the states of the files which are in other branches and always points to the current HEAD files.**

And if we have done any changes in the master branch we have to commit that before going to other branch to see the previous version of the file.
